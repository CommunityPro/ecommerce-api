# Getting Started

Welcome to eCommerce API, the perfect solution for testing and developing your eCommerce applications. This guide will help you quickly get started with our API and explore its features.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- **Access to eCommerce API:** To access our API, you need to sign up for an account on our platform.

- **API Key:** You'll need an API key to make authenticated requests. You can obtain your API key by [following these steps](/guide/auth.md).

- **HTTP Client:** We recommend using a tool like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) for sending HTTP requests.

## Making Your First API Request

1. **Authentication:** To authenticate your requests, include your API key in the request headers. Add a header with the following key-value pair:

   - **Key:** `Authorization`
   - **Value:** `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`

2. **Select an Endpoint:** Choose an endpoint from our [API documentation](/guide) to interact with. For example, you can start by fetching a list of products.

3. **Send the Request:** Use your HTTP client to send a GET request to the selected endpoint. You can explore various query parameters to customize your request further.

4. **View the Response:** You'll receive a JSON response with the data related to the endpoint you queried. The response will contain details like product information, categories, and more.

## Exploring API Features

Once you've made your first request and received a successful response, you can further explore [Your Ecommerce API] by:

- **Creating Products:** Test product creation by sending POST requests to the product creation endpoint.
