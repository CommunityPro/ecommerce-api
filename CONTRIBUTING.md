# Contributing Guidelines 🙌

This documentation contains a set of guidelines to help you during the contribution process.
I'm happy to welcome all the contributions from anyone willing to add new scripts to this repository. Thank you for helping out and remember,
**No contribution is too small.**

## Steps to Contribute 👩‍💻👨‍💻

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via raising an [issue](https://github.com/CommunityPro/ecommerce-api/issues)

Follow these steps to make a contribution:

_NB: Please use [pnpm](https:pnpm.io) as your package manager_

### 📌 Step 1

Fork the `ecommerce-api` repository to your GitHub account. Go to your machine and run:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/ecommerce-api.git
```

### 📌 Step 2

Change into the project folder, in this case (support)

```sh
cd ecommerce-api
```

### 📌 Step 3

Create a new branch (This is a necessary step, so don't skip it) and make your changes.

```sh
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

### 📌 Step 4

Add your changes to the staging area.

```sh
git add .
```

### 📌 Step 5

Commit your changes (Make your commit short but concise. You can read best commit message practices [here](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

```sh
git commit -m "commit message"
```

### 📌 Step 6

Push back to your repo

```sh
git push origin main
```

### 📌 Step 8

Create a PR on Github. (Don't just hit the create a pull request button, you must write a PR message to clarify why and what you are contributing)

### Note:

> - Make sure your local branch is always up to date before pushing or making a PR.
> - Branch name should reflect what you're working on
> - Do not edit/delete someone else's code in this repository. You can only insert new files/folder in this repository.
> - Do not make any changes to the config files.
> - Fix linting changes before committing.
> - Give a meaningful name to whatever file or folder you are adding.
> - Raise issues for bugs, don't fix them outrightly.

## What should I keep in mind while contributing? 💡

- When you are contributing, make sure that the work is entirely your own and not from some other source.
- All the scripts must follow [PEP 8 Style Guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
